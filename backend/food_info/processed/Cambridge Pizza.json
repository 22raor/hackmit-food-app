Walked back to my car with the pizza cradled to me with one arm, lid open, and I ate every single slice before I got there (where I slept, no way was I driving).\n\nAtmosphere is an old in and out shop with burnt orange booths.

What was an issue was that my food arrived in very poor condition. The wrap, which is made with sauce and wet ingredients, had been sliced in half through the foil wrapper, then wrapped up, so the entire tortilla was soggy and covered in oil and some filling, and there were pieces of foil inside the two halves of the wrap that I had to pick out. My Cheesy Garlic bread, meanwhile, had not spent enough time in the oven; the cheese had only partially melted, and the bread was still very underbaked - soft, squishy, and doughy.\n\nAnother problem for me is that there is no way to contact them via text.
