food. Once you walk in, you feel instantly at home. The music is authentic Haitian music and the atmosphere and decor echo that as well.\n\nWe ordered boulette (meatballs) and the cabrit en sos (goat in sauce) as well as the accra fritters & lam fri (fried breadfruit) as appetizers. Everything was flavorful, well portioned, and well presented. Would def come back to try other dishes.\n\nSo proud of this lovely haitiam restaurant \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "I\u2019ve been going to this Haitian restaurant regularly, and every single time the experience is absolutely amazing. The atmosphere is vibrant, warm, and festive; it always feels like a little escape, whether you\u2019re going with friends, family, or even solo.\n\nThe staff is consistently attentive, welcoming, and efficient. You can tell they care about offering a great experience from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the food : it\u2019s simply outstanding. Rich flavors, generous portions, and authentic Haitian taste that hits every time.\n\nDefinitely one of my go-to spots. If you\u2019re looking for a place that serves amazing food with good energy and great service, this is the one.", "Maybe I order on a bad day but the goat is burnt sauce tasteless rice ight . I oder DD I wish I could ask for my money back the whole thing horrible respectful.  They chicken no epis, I really wish I could get my money back.Hope they do better next time", "The food was 10/10. I got the meatless platter. Rice and beans, salad, plantains. Each came with side of some stew to put on rice and it was all very very very delicious. A little spicy was the stew but not too spicy. Side of spicy cabbage was nice and spicy. I do wish there was more salad and plantains that came on the side but we were given plenty of rice. The side of Accra was also great. Perfect crispness. I also wish there was a few more for the price but still worth it. I think 5 or 6 came with it. The restaurant was clean and very nicely decorated. The bathroom was clean and there was a bar. I would definitely come here again and would recommend. I LOVE Haitian food and this was very good.", "I highly recommend this restaurant. Very clean and the food is excellent.
